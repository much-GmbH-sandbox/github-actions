# CI/CD Pipeline for Odoo Addons
#
# Reads configuration from pyproject.toml:
#   [odoo]
#   version = 17.0
#   build_docker = true    # Enable Docker build on deploy branches
#   edition = "enterprise"
#
# Flow:
#   PR: Quality Checks → Jenkins (Unit Tests)
#   Push to deploy branch: Quality Checks → Jenkins (Tests + Deploy if build_docker=true)
#   Push to non-deploy branch: Quality Checks → Jenkins (Tests only)
#
# Version pinning: Uses @v1 for stability. Check github-actions repo for latest version.
